This is a Bronchoscopy simulator. There are 4 levels, details on what each level does can be found in the design document .pdf in the asset folder. Camera controls are handled in CameraControl.cs, the camera is moved by adding force to a rigid body so that collisions are detected between the camera and the walls of the lungs. The main camera also has a collision control script that handles playing a coughing animation when the sides of the lung walls are contacted too many times. 

All level behaviors are housed in their own empty gameobjects in the scene. Most levels require the camera to enter a desired passage to trigger an event. These collisions are handled in LungCollisionBehavior.cs which is housed on each part of the lungs (the model is 3 pieces). Events are triggered according to the current level enum which is set from LevelManager.cs. LevelManager.cs sets the current level enum and initialized each level behavior when the respective level button is pressed on the main canvas.
